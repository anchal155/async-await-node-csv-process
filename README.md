# async-await-node-csv-process

Do the npm install....


We can remove unrequired packages....

Used whole async/await proces to process the file as this is due to version updrade that we may require in other services or repos as well to connect to mogodb high chances if we dont do that then it may create a problmen in future...


We need to reframe the whole code of server.js for processingEligibility file of daemon for now in order to make it work... This is applicale for one switch case only and one file for now.... if this works we can make for others as well....


Also, I removed async.waterfall method as it is not working properly or as expected and due to which we were facing issues...

Let me know if any changes required.....
